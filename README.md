## Git Commands ##

We also learned about using Git which goes hand on hand with terminal and markdown. We create a repository and check the box "initialize repository into README.me". After the repository is created there will be a link we can copy for terminal usage. The link is added  to the terminal by using the "git clone" command after git clone add the link and press enter. 
    
1. git clone (url) - clones repository to your computer
2. git add(file/directory) - adds change in the working directory to the staging area
3. git commit - commits/saves changes in staging area to the local repository
   * Will get prompt to enter message. Enter the message and then press ESC :wq and ENTER for it to take
   * -m  "message" = use this to prevent being prompted for a message
4. git push - pushes local repository to the github repository
